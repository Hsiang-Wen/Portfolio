# Obsession

**Format**: Sound Collage (7–8 min)  
**Role**: Vocal performance, arrangement, mixing, sound design  
**Tools**: Logic Pro, field recordings, custom samples

## Concept
A sound journey transforming romantic obsession into self-obsession and self-liberation. Each segment transitions between iconic covers, supported by cinematic ambience and spatial sound design.

## Track Segments (tentative):
1. My Junk (Spring Awakening) – 0:00–0:50
2. My Strange Addiction (Billie Eilish) – 0:50–2:00
3. Creep (Daniela Andrade cover) – 2:00–3:30
4. Defying Gravity (Wicked) – 3:30–5:30
5. Brand New Me (Alicia Keys) – 5:30–7:30

## Transition Design
Use of field recordings (cicadas, traffic, rain, broken glass) to build story arcs and scene shifts.
